	# This is an annoying workaround. When I run
	# ‚Äúsudo nixos-rebuild boot --install-bootloader‚Äù, I get this
	# error:
	#
	#   grub-install: error: cannot find a GRUB drive for /dev/vda.  Check your device.map.
	#
	# That error indicates that there‚Äôs two problems:
	# 1. We‚Äôre trying to install GRUB to a device that doesn‚Äôt
	# exist.
	# 2. We aren‚Äôt using a persistent block device name [1].
	#
	# Ideally, I would just install GRUB to
	# /dev/disk/by-uuid/<whatever>, but there was nothing in that
	# directory for the disk itself (there was only a symlink for
	# the partition). OK, what about /dev/by-label? Nope, the
	# partition table can‚Äôt have a label [2]. OK, what about
	# /dev/disk/by-id? Nope, that directory doesn‚Äôt exist on this
	# machine. OK, what about /dev/disk/by-path? Nope, that
	# directory also doesn‚Äôt exist.
	#
	# There is a directory named /dev/disk/by-diskseq which I had
	# never heard of before, but disk sequence numbers aren‚Äôt
	# persistent. For example, let‚Äôs say that you plug a USB drive
	# in, at it‚Äôs assigned disk sequence number 11. Then, you unplug
	# the USB drive, and plug it back in. Now, its disk
	# sequence number will be higher than 11, and there will be no
	# disk with sequence number 11 [3].
	#
	# Apparently, the disk itself appears in /dev/disk/by-partuuid
	# on some peoples systems [4] (even though it‚Äôs not a
	# partition), but it‚Äôs not there for me.
	#
	# As a result, I‚Äôm adding a udev rule that will create a
	# persistent symlink for me. I‚Äôm not putting it in one of the
	# usual directories so that it doesn‚Äôt end up overwriting a
	# different rule. (I‚Äôm hoping that one day I‚Äôll do an update
	# that will make something appear in /dev/disk/by-uuid. If that
	# happens, then I won‚Äôt need this extra udev rule anymore.)
