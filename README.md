# Jason‚Äôs [NixOS] Config

How to install and configure NixOS the way I do.

## Installation

Follow the instructions in [NixOS‚Äôs Installation Instructions](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#ch-installation).
Each section in that manual is given a number like 1, 2.2 or 2.2.1. Bellow is a
list of section numbers and any additional notes that I have for them:

- (1) Download the minimal ISO image. Also download its SHA-256 file, but
download it from a separate Tor Browser session.

- (2) If you‚Äôre installing NixOS on `jasonyundt.website.home.arpa`, then create
a VM. Its specs should match [the specs of Vultr‚Äôs $3.50 per month ‚ÄúRegular
Performance‚Äù VM](https://www.vultr.com/pricing/#cloud-compute). Don‚Äôt forget to
make it a UEFI system and not a BIOS one.

- (2.1) Make sure that you boot into UEFI mode.
	Once you‚Äôre at a command prompt, run
	[this command](https://askubuntu.com/a/162896):

		[ -d /sys/firmware/efi ] && echo UEFI || echo BIOS

	If it outputs ‚ÄúUEFI‚Äù, then you‚Äôre good.

- (2.2.1) Give `jasonyundt.website.home.arpa` 2GiB of swap. This is a pretty
arbitrary number.

- (2.2.3) Use the following labels:
	- `nixos-root` for the root partition.
	- `nixos-swap` for the swap partition.
	- `nixos-hdd` for the data partition on the hard drive.

## Post-installation

1. Get a copy of this repo on the machine.
2. In `deployment/home-manager.nix`, make sure that the version number in the
tarball‚Äôs URL matches the version of NixOS you installed.
3. In `configuration.nix`, import the following:
	- `./deployment/home-manager.nix`
	- `./deployment/common.nix`
	- One of the system specific configs:
		- `./deployment/jason-desktop-linux.nix`,
		- `./deployment/jason-laptop-linux.nix`,
		- `./deployment/jasonyundt.website.nix` or
		- `./deployment/jasonyundt.website.home.arpa.nix`
4. In `./deployment/common.nix`, make sure that `home.stateversion` matches the
version of NixOS you installed.
5. Run `./deploy.sh`.
6. Reboot.
7. Log in as root and set jayman‚Äôs password.

### Instructions specific to Jason‚Äôs Web Site

These post-installation steps should only be done on `jasonyundt.website` or
`jasonyundt.website.home.arpa`.

1. If one doesn‚Äôt already exist, create a new email address on
`jasonyundt.email`. The address should be `<fqdn>@jasonyundt.email` where
`<fqdn>` is the domain name of the machine you‚Äôre currently setting up.
2. On the machine that you‚Äôre setting up, create a `~root/mail-password` file
that contains the password for that email address.
3. Make sure that only root has access to that file:

		sudo chmod 400 ~root/mail-password

### Instructions specific to graphical installs

These post-installation steps should only be done on graphical systems.

1. Log in via SDDM.
2. Use KGpg to create a new GPG key to use for a KDE Wallet. Make sure that you
save a revocation key.
3. Back up the revocation key in the KeePass database. The other parts of the
key aren‚Äôt really needed since this key is only going to be used locally on
one machine.
4. Use KWalletManager to create a new wallet named ‚Äúdefault‚Äù that uses the
GPG key. If there was an existing wallet before you created this one, delete
that wallet.
5. In KDE Wallet settings, make sure that the new wallet is the default wallet
and that the wallet is closed automatically after 10 minutes.
6. In KWalletManager, add a password entry named ‚Äújason@jasonyundt.email‚Äù.
7. Import Keyboard shortcuts.kksrc. Go to System
Settings>Workspace>Shortcuts>Shortcuts>Import Scheme‚Ä¶
8. Customize the rest of the system settings.
9. In Firefox, install the following extensions:
	- Plasma Browser integration
	- uBlock Origin
10. In Firefox, enable HTTPS only mode.
11. In Tor Browser Launcher Settings, check ‚ÄúDownload over system Tor‚Äù and
click ‚ÄúSave & Exit‚Äù.
12. In the Tor Browser, enable HTTPS only mode.
13. In the Tor Browser, install uBlock Origin.
14. Set up any additional email accounts in Thunderbird.
15. In Kalendar, set up a reminder on the first of every month to review
installed packages.

## Hints for Contributors

If you decide to contribute to this project, then I hope that you‚Äôll find the
following hints helpful:

- Use tabs for indentation. The only exception to this rule is in YAML files
because [YAML requires spaces for
indentation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#61-indentation-spaces). In YAML files,
use 4 spaces for indentation.
- You can use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically check your
contributions. Follow [these instructions](https://pre-commit.com/#quick-start)
to get started. Skip [the part about creating a pre-commit
configuration](https://pre-commit.com/#2-add-a-pre-commit-configuration).
- Sometimes, it‚Äôs OK if a file doesn‚Äôt fully pass all of pre-commit‚Äôs checks. In
those cases,
[skip the failing hook(s)](https://pre-commit.com/#temporarily-disabling-hooks).
