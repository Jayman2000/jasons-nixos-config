The future commit that this commit talks about is 37bf45e (Replace
install ISOs with install drives, 2024-03-17). That being said, I ended
up not using disko-install when creating that commit. As it turns out,
disko-install requires that you have a flakes.nix file [1]. I don’t have
a flakes.nix file yet, so I’m not able to use disko-install.
