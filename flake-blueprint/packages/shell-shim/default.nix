      If you use Nushell as a login shell on NixOS, then certain NixOS
      features won’t work properly. For example, I tried to set
      `programs.ssh.startAgent` to `true` in my NixOS config, but it
      didn’t work properly. When you set `programs.ssh.startAgent` to
      true, [it’s supposed to potentially set the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`
      environment variable][1]. The code that potentially sets that
      environment variable only gets run if you use a more traditional
      shell. If you use a less traditional shell like Nushell, then the
      code won’t get run.

      `shell-shim` helps work around that problem. Specifically,
      `shell-shim` will use Bash to launch Nushell. Bash will set all of
      the environment variables that are supposed to be set before it
      lauches Nushell. This effectively side-steps most (all?) issues
      that are caused by using Nushell as a login shell.

      If `shell-shim` is run with no command-line arguments, then it
      will use Bash to launch Nushell as described above. However, if
      `shell-shim` is given any command-line arguments, then it will not
      lauch Nushell at all. Instead, it will just launch Bash with all
      of the the command-line arguments that were given to `shell-shim`.
      The idea here is to make sure that `shell-shim` doesn’t break code
      that looks like this:

      ```bash
      "$USERS_LOGIN_SHELL" -c '. script.sh'
      ```

      If someone wrote code that runs the user’s login shell with a few
      command-line arguments, then they probably expect the login shell
      to be a traditional shell and not something like Nushell.
