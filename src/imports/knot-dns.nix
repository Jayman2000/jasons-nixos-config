	# It can be tricky to get the DNS records for a mailserver
	# right. While it might be more robust to use an external DNS
	# provider, it would mean that I would have to find a way to
	# sync DNS records with that provider. There would be a lot of
	# configuration that wouldn‚Äôt be specified in any sort of Nix
	# expression.
	#
	# Ultimately, if I run my my own DNS server, then pretty much
	# everything that I need to run this mailserver can be declared
	# by this NixOS configuration.
	#
	# I chose Knot DNS based on this table [1]. It seems like Knot
	# DNS is the only authoritative DNS server that has at least
	# partial support for DNS over QUIC.
