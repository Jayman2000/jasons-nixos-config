	# Most of the time, I‚Äôm going to be using a UTF-8 locale. That
	# being said, not everyone uses a UTF-8 locale, and I‚Äôve
	# accidentally written software that breaks if you don‚Äôt use a
	# UTF-8 locale. Specifically, I had written software that
	# assumed that Python‚Äôs open() function would default to using
	# UTF-8. In reality, Python‚Äôs open() function defaults to using
	# your locale encoding [1], and using a UTF-8 locale encoding by
	# default is still a beta feature on Windows [2][3].
	#
	# I‚Äôm adding an extra, non-UTF-8 locale here so that I can test
	# out software to make sure that it works on systems that don‚Äôt
	# use a UTF-8 locale. Specifically, I chose to create a locale
	# that uses plain-old ASCII. Pretty much every character
	# set contains everything in ASCII plus more characters. The
	# only exceptions that I‚Äôm aware of are ASCII-variants that
	# replace certain characters (example: [4]) and EBCDIC. I tried
	# creating an EBCDIC locale, but the build process crashed with
	# an error about EBCDIC not being ASCII-compatible.
